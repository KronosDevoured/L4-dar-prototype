# Launch this bot with RLBotGUI
# It will measure angular velocity with diagonal stick inputs (pitch+yaw) while DAR is active
# Data will be saved to: C:\Users\itsju\Documents\L4-dar-prototype\automated_tests\RL_diagonal_measurement.csv

# This matches the L4 test format so we can compare RL behavior vs L4 physics model
